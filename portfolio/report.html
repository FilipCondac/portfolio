    <h1>Individual Website Report</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Filip Condac</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>I started the project with the idea of what I would roughly like to have done in the next 10 years. I started
        this by doing reaserch on other Software Engineers portfolios because
        before starting this project, I wasn't informed of what a portfolio might look for a software engineer. I then
        got an idea of what it consisted of and created my own wireframes with my own
        design and structure, but coverign same content. This website says about me that I have expereince working
        mainly in OS & API development. I worked for big companies such as Cloudflare and Google.
        But also worked on freelance project and also community built things such as Raspbian.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I thought the audience might have been a possible employer, I didn't really want to bore them with tons of
        pointless detail but also not make the website feel empty. I made key things
        an employer might look for easy to access and find. Also making contacting me very quick and accessible.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>https://www.chuckgroom.com/</li>
        I felt like this was a very good portfolio. It has everything an employer might need to know about him. He has a
        very brief but informative About me and also his projects. At the bottom
        if anyone needs to access him it's quick and straight forward.
        <li>http://noahappel.me/</li>
        I also like the simplicity of this. I particulary like the "Work section" as you can see what he worked on and
        if you select the project it allows for more information about the project.
        Although I found it hard to see that you could actually view more info about his projects as you hover above
        them.
        <li>https://www.ybrikman.com/</li>
        This portfolio is very simple but straight forward. It has quick acess to his information, it is easy to access
        his media pages and it also shares a lot about his past speakings and experience.
    </ul>

    <p>https://www.springboard.com/blog/programmer-portfolio/</p>
    <p>This guide helped me fill out the content of my page. I used it to help guide me further on what my portfolio
        should consist of.</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>The websites Accessibility was made following a guide from w3.org
        (https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility). I then evaluated the website manually</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The website has alternative text for all images</li>
        <li>The website doesn't require a mouse to be used(you can fully naviagte using the tab button)</li>
        <li>Colour scheme of the website is very easy to differ</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have made the site easy to navigate and straight forward. I tried making elements very easy to read and also
        tried to make colour contrast as best as I could, to make text easily readable
        I added a TOP button which appears in the bottom right corner, allowing users to go back up top to the nav menu
        quickly, if they have scrolled down far on a small screen device. Also adding the hamburger/dropdown menu for
        mobile users
        was part of making my website more accessible and easy to use.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>The thing I struggled with most before was being able to position my elements as I wanted to so they fit well
        with other elements on my page. Most of my reaserch was helped on this topic by
        W3Schools.com I feel a much better understanding of how to use floats, margins, borders and paddings in order to
        achieve the element placement I wanted. Code wasn't directly taken from the internet
        for this piece of learning but I had used it and adapted in a way to suit me.
    </p>
    <p>When starting this project I had next to no understandign of how reading and writing DOM worked. This project
        gave me much better understanding. My main example of reading/writing DOM is placed
        in my Projects section. It was code written by me, using knowledge I have aquired in class and doing only
        reaserch on how to access and write certain elements. Such as editing the .src of an image. I again
        have gotten this information on W3Schools.com. The NAV Menu was an example taken directly from W3, although I
        have comented the Java to show my understanding of how it works.
    </p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>I did not use a library of plugin to my website as I felt I didn't need to and everything I had aimed for was
        achievable without them. This was due to me aiming to keep by website simple and straight
        to the point. Other resuources I have used were things such as Google-Fonts. This was due to not being satisfied
        with default fonts and honestly not understanding how to make the fonts look nicer.
    </p>
    <p>For my Slide show I was going to use the carousel feature on bootstrap. But instead while reasarching that I have
        found a much easier method using default JavaScaript which I did directly
        take but I had to modify the code in order to make Validation standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <h3>What worked well</h3>
    <p>Following my wireframes was easier than anticipated. Like I mentioned before, I had trouble placing my elements
        as I wanted to but now I felt like it wasn't a problem</p>
    <p>Creating working media Queries worked much better than in the past. I have found making a phone version much
        easier than before and elements aligned/scaled nicely. Making them neat and readable on
        any size screen.
    </p>
    <p>Following an example and creating something similar to what I have seen online went well. I feel like my website
        follows the structure and ideas of websites I have refered to, making my website
        look like a proper software Developer portfolio.
    </p>
    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    <p>I feel like a major Improvement could be the conent of the Page. I feel like I didn't get creative enough or the
        conent didn't match one of a Profestional SE. Although the strucutre is there.
        This shows in my Projects description I feel like, as I don't know professional terms and I had a hard time
        getting information. I need to do more reaserch on this kind of content.
    </p>
    <p>I also feel like the reading and writing of the DOM in the Projects section could be worked on. Although it was
        my first time and attempt I feel that it can be buggy and appear as choppy. This section also
        is giving a hard time on mobile as it can make it a bit hard to read. This could be fixed by better
        understanding of event listeners and how they work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the aim of the website was to be straight to the point, I feel like my page looks empty. This could be
        due to element positioning and scaling, which I could do better if I had a better understanding
        of how a professional would position these. Some pages come off as empty and lack of content due to this.
        Especially in my Contact page. Although I felt like I included everything I could.
